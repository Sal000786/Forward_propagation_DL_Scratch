# Forward Propagation in Deep Learning from Scratch

## Overview

This repository provides a beginner-friendly implementation of forward propagation in deep learning, implemented from scratch. The code is designed to help newcomers to the field grasp the fundamental concept of how data passes through a neural network, leading to predictions. The accompanying images aim to provide a clear visual intuition of the forward propagation process.

## Contents

- `forward_propagation_scratch.ipynb`: Python script containing the code for forward propagation.
- `images(1.jpg,2.jpg,3.jpg,4.jpg)/`: Folder containing visual aids to enhance understanding.
-  Link to a YouTube video for additional reference and clarification is given in the notebook.
-  here's the video link as well https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MuiScUkboE&list=PLKnIA16_RmvYuZauWaPlRTC54KxSNLtNn&index=10
